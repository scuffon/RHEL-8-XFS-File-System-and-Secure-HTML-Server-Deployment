# RHEL 8 XFS File System and Secure HTML Server Deployment

## Project Overview
In this project, I created an XFS file system on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) server with an 8 GB disk. Subsequently, I deployed an HTML server on this disk using Apache HTTP Server. Additionally, to bolster security, I configured the HTML server to only accept connections through SSH.

## Project Duration
January 2024 - April 2024

## Project Objectives
- Establish a robust file system using XFS on a RHEL server.
- Deploy an HTML server using Apache HTTP Server for hosting web content.
- Implement security measures by allowing HTML server connections only through SSH.

## Responsibilities
- Provisioned a RHEL server and created an 8 GB disk for the project.
- Formatted the disk with the XFS file system to ensure optimal storage performance and scalability.
- Installed and configured Apache HTTP Server to serve HTML content on the XFS-formatted disk.
- Implemented security measures to restrict HTML server access solely through SSH for enhanced protection against unauthorized access attempts.

## Technologies Utilized
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8
- XFS file system
- Apache HTTP Server
- Secure Shell (SSH)

## Achievements
- Successfully established a reliable XFS file system on the RHEL server, optimizing storage performance.
- Deployed an HTML server using Apache HTTP Server, facilitating the hosting of web content.
- Enhanced security by configuring the HTML server to exclusively accept connections through SSH, mitigating potential security vulnerabilities.

## Future Enhancements
Potential future enhancements for this project could include:
- Integration of additional security features, such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems, for further fortification against cyber threats.
- Implementation of load balancing and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability and reliability of the HTML server.

This project exemplifies my proficiency in Linux server administration, file system management, web server deployment, and security configuration, all of which are pivotal skills in the field of system administration and cybersecurity.
